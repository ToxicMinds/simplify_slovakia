# Vision: Why Simplify Slovakia Exists

## The Problem

Moving to a foreign country is already stressful. Adding Slovak bureaucracy on top makes it overwhelming.

**Current state of affairs:**
- Facebook groups with contradicting advice
- Outdated blog posts from 2018
- Expat forums with "maybe try this?" suggestions
- Paying €500+ to relocation companies
- Missing deadlines and facing fines

**What people actually need:**
A clear, deterministic checklist that says: "Given your situation, here's EXACTLY what to do, in order."

## Why Not AI Chatbots?

1. **Hallucination risk** - AI can't be trusted with legal requirements
2. **Lack of auditability** - Can't verify where advice comes from
3. **Inconsistency** - Same question, different answers
4. **Liability** - Who's responsible for bad advice?

## Our Approach

**Deterministic checklists based on explicit rules.**

- Same input = same output (always)
- Rules are auditable YAML files
- No interpretation, just navigation
- Free and open-source forever

## Success Criteria (v1.0)

1. Non-EU employee can get from job offer to working legally
2. Zero ambiguity in checklist
3. Every step has official government link
4. Runs on AWS free tier (costs nothing)
5. Open-source, community-maintainable

## Non-Goals (v1.0)

- ❌ Not legal advice (we don't interpret)
- ❌ Not AI-powered (deterministic only)
- ❌ Not for citizens (expats/immigrants only)
- ❌ Not Slovakia-specific forever (expandable later)

## Long-Term Vision (Beyond MVP)

- Cover all EU countries
- Support all entry types (work, study, family, etc.)
- AI-powered form filling (with human verification)
- Community-contributed updates to rules
- API for immigration lawyers to use
