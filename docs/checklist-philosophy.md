# Checklist Philosophy: Why Deterministic Over AI

## Core Principle

> Bureaucracy is deterministic. Our tool should be too.

## The AI Temptation

It's 2025. Everyone wants to "add AI" to their product. Why aren't we?

### AI is Good At:
- Natural language understanding
- Summarizing complex documents
- Generating human-like responses
- Handling ambiguity

### Bureaucracy is:
- Unambiguous (you must do X by date Y)
- Documented (rules are written in laws)
- Sequential (step 1 before step 2)
- Verifiable (authorities check compliance)

**Mismatch:** AI handles ambiguity well. Bureaucracy has no ambiguity to handle.

## Why Checklists Win

### 1. Correctness
**Checklist:** "According to Act 404/2011, you must register within 10 days"  
**AI:** "You should probably register soon, maybe within 10-14 days"

One is precise. One is vague. Bureaucracy punishes vagueness.

### 2. Auditability
**Checklist:** Rule in YAML → Step in UI → Government website confirms  
**AI:** Magic black box → Answer appears → Source unclear

You can verify a checklist. You can't verify an AI's reasoning.

### 3. Consistency
**Checklist:** Same input → Same output (always)  
**AI:** Same input → Different output (sometimes)

Bureaucracy doesn't accept "it gave me different advice yesterday."

### 4. Liability
**Checklist:** "Here's what the law says. Go verify."  
**AI:** "I'm 87% confident you need to..."

We're not giving legal advice. We're pointing you to official sources.

## When AI Makes Sense (Future)

We're not anti-AI. We're pro-correct-tool-for-the-job.

**AI can help with:**
1. **Form filling** - "Translate your situation into form language"
2. **Document extraction** - "Pull data from your employment contract"
3. **Clarification** - "What does 'duly authenticated' mean?"
4. **Translation** - Slovak documents → English

But the **source of truth** remains the checklist, not the AI.

## The Hybrid Future
AI assists. Checklist decides.

## Why This Matters

**Without this philosophy:**
- We become another "AI immigration chatbot"
- Users can't trust the output
- We face liability issues
- Rules become hidden in model weights

**With this philosophy:**
- Clear separation: AI = assistance, Rules = truth
- Users can verify everything
- Open-source community can audit rules
- Lawyers can review our logic

## Summary

Deterministic checklists are:
- ✅ Verifiable
- ✅ Consistent  
- ✅ Auditable
- ✅ Legally defensible

AI is great, but for this problem, explicit rules win.
